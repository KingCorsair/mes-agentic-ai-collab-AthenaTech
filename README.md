   - Performs quality assurance on recommendations
   - Manages alert escalation for critical issues

5. **⚡ Executor Agent**
   - Sends email notifications with detailed reports
   - Executes immediate action items
   - Coordinates with manufacturing departments
   - Integrates with MES APIs for action execution

6. **🔍 Supervisor Agent**

### AI/ML Framework
- **Strands Framework** - Multi-agent orchestration
- **Amazon Bedrock** - Claude Sonnet 4 LLM integration
- **Boto3** - AWS services integration


### Setup

1. **Environment Setup**



   Create and activate a Python virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

2. **AWS Configuration**

   Configure AWS environment variables by creating a `.env` file:

   ```text
   AWS_REGION="YourRegion" #example us-east-1
   AWS_PROFILE="myprofile" #from ~/.aws/config
   ```

3. **Install Required Packages**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Generate the Sample MES Database**

   ```bash
   # Clone the repository
   git clone https://github.com/aws-samples/industrial-data-store-simulation-chatbot.git

   # Navigate to the data generator directory
   cd industrial-data-store-simulation-chatbot/app_factory/data_generator

   # Create tables and simulation data (auto-detects if database exists)
   python3 sqlite-synthetic-mes-data.py --config data_pools.json --lookback 90 --lookahead 14
   ```

   This will create the database file `mes.db` in the project root directory if it doesn't exist, or refresh the data if it does.

5. **SetEnvironment Variables**

   Configure environment variables by editing `mes_config.sh` file then run:


   ```bash
   source mes_config.sh
   ```

## Running the Applications

You can run the applications independently or together:

### Run All Components Together

```bash
# Start the combined application
python3 -m streamlit run app.py
```
